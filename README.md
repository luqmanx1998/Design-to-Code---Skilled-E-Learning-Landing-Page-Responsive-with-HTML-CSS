![DESIGN-IMG](preview.jpg)

## Overview

Yet another small, but beautiful landing page that was really fun to build out ! This was a good workout for my HTML/CSS skills, and I can feel myself getting much better and comfortable with each practice. This one was took me much faster to code up as there were many reusable components in this layout such as the cards and the buttons. 

## Challenges Faced

- **Linear gradients** 
  The toughest part of this challenge actually was trying to get linear-gradients to transition. I learned today that it's not actually supported, though there is a workaround that I tried exploring ! Though I didn't quite get it to work, I'll look more into it soon. Nonetheless, I still managed to finish the landing page much faster than usual, so I think that's a great sign.


## Tools & Techniques

- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **Responsive Design:** 
- **Problem-Solving:** Drawing on previous project experience to solve new challenges.
